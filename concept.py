Deep Dive into Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Key Terms and Real-World Applications

Explore the fundamentals and advanced concepts of machine learning and deep learning in this 
comprehensive guide. From algorithms to evaluation metrics, we cover it all, providing clear explanations 
and real-world examples to help you understand these complex topics. Whether you’re new to the field or looking 
to deepen your expertise, this blog has something for everyone interested in AI and its applications.


1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis): 
→ PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique, PCA transforms the data into a set of orthogonal components that 
capture the most variance in the data, making it easier to visualize and process.if we have many similar features 
pca can be used to to reduce dimensionality and have fewer features which represents the all those features.

2. Feature Selection: →
→ feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in a model, and getting rid 
of noise in data using Correlation matrix technique.

3. BERT: →
→ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed for natural 
language processing (NLP) tasks. BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a bidirectional manner, meaning 
it considers the context from both left and right directions. This allows it to understand the nuanced meaning of 
words in context. BERT is used in search engines to better understand user queries and provide more relevant results.

4. Vanishing Gradient: →
→ In vanishing gradients the model’s weights are updated very slowly, making it difficult for the network to learn 
results. 

5. Exploding Gradient: →
→ When weights change fast & frequently the exploding gradient occurs.  These can cause the model’s weights to grow 
uncontrollably, leading to instability and poor model performance. Techniques like gradient clipping are used to 
address this issue.

6. Gradient Boosting: →
→ Gradient boosting improves predictions step by step. Each new model learns from the mistakes of the previous one, 
making the overall prediction more accurate. This helps the model learn complex patterns and make better predictions.

7. Random Forest: →
→ Random forest improves predictions by using many decision trees instead of just one. Each tree learns from a random 
part of the data, and the final result is based on the average (for numbers) or majority vote (for categories). 
This makes the model more accurate and reduces overfitting.
Random forests are used in credit scoring to predict the likelihood of default. 
By aggregating the predictions of multiple decision trees, the model provides more robust and accurate predictions.
